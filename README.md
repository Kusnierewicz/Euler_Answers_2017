# The Odin Project Assignment: Javascript Basics - Solve a few problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) 

List of solved problems:

1. Multiples of 3 and 5. (Solution in JavaScript)
2. Even Fibonacci numbers. (Solution in JavaScript)

## What is Projcet Euler (source: Wikipedia):

>Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with >computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation >in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide.[2] It includes over 600 problems,[3] with a >new one added every weekend (except during the summer). Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a >minute using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer. Problems can be sorted on difficulty. A forum specific to each >question may be viewed after the user has correctly answered the given question.[4] As of August 2017 Project Euler has about >720,000[5] users, from all over the world, who have solved at least one problem.[6]

>Participants can track their progress through achievement levels based on the number of problems solved. A new level is reached >for every 25 problems solved. Special awards exist for solving special combinations of problems, for instance there is an award >for solving fifty prime numbered problems. A special Eulerians level exists to track achievement based on the fastest fifty >solvers of recent problems so that newer members can compete without solving older problems.[7]

>There are 111 sequences[8] in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) referencing Project Euler problems.
